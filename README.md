# R-Audio-Tools

## What is this?

R-Audio-Tools is a
[Distrobox](https://distrobox.it/) container based on the
[rstudio2u](https://github.com/jmgirard/rstudio2u) Docker
image. The install process is modular; you can install the
base container and install your own R tools, or use the
provided scripts to install R package development tools,
audio analysis and synthesis tools, or both.
